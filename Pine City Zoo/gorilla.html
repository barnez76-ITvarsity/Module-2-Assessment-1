						<h3>GORILLA</h3>
						<p>Gorillas are ground dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of 
							central Africa. The eponymous genus Gorilla is divided into two species, the
							eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies.
							They are the largest living primates by physical size. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar
							to that of humansby 95% to 99% depending on what is counted, and they are the next closest living
							relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos
						 </p>
						 <p>Gorillas natural habitat covers tropical and subtropical forests in Africa. Although their range
						 covers a small percentage in Africa, gorillas cover a widee range of elevations.
